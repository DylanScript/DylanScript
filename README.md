 - This version of DylanScript was actually made on a simple programming language called small basic and this DylanScript only consists of 1 main file (DylanScript.sb).
 - You can download the full DylanScript at DylanScript.wordpress.com/download/ds1 and the source code also comes with it (and on this page).
 - If you have any questions please feel free to email me at CodeDylanScript@gmail.com.
